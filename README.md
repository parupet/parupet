If you're from Pony Town: MDNI. Also I rarely talk unless spoken to first. Sitting nearby doesn't count. 
Sometimes I'm tabbed out. Also in regards to whispers I oftentimes don't notice them for a while... lol.

And before anyone comes at me about the schizoid comment in my sidebar: I am, in fact, schizoid. 
"Disordered" only because we live in a capitalist hellscape.

I don't care about your opinion on this matter or any other. I don't know you and I don't care to know you, therefore your opinion goes to the recycling bin to be lost at sea.

You can find more doodles on my bluesky. You can find my terrible Elin PCC mod (Undertale+Other additions) in my repositories somewhere.
