If you're from Pony Town: MDNI. Also I rarely talk unless spoken to first. Sitting nearby doesn't count. 
Sometimes I'm tabbed out. Also in regards to whispers I oftentimes don't notice them for a while... lol.

You can find more doodles on my bluesky. You can find my terrible Elin PCC mod (Undertale+Other additions) in my repositories somewhere.
